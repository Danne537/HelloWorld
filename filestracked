git-format-patch[1], git-am[1]: These convert series of git commits into emailed patches, and vice versa, useful for projects such as the Linux kernel which rely heavily on emailed patches.

git-bisect[1]: When there is a regression in your project, one way to track down the bug is by searching through the history to find the exact commit thatâ€™s to blame. git bisect can help you perform a binary search for that commit. It is smart enough to perform a close-to-optimal search even in the case of complex non-linear history with lots of merged branches.

gitworkflows[7]: Gives an overview of recommended workflows.

giteveryday[7]: Everyday Git with 20 Commands Or So.
